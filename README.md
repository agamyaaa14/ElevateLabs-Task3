## 📚 Task 3: Linear Regression

---

## 📋 Objective
Predict housing prices using Multiple Linear Regression based on various features from the dataset.

---

## 🛠️ What was done
- Imported and preprocessed the dataset.
- Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
- Split data into training and testing sets (80-20 split).
- Trained a Multiple Linear Regression model.
- Evaluated model using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score
- Plotted Actual vs Predicted Prices for visual evaluation.

---

## 📊 Results
- Achieved reasonable accuracy with multiple features.
- Most predictions were close to actual values on the scatter plot.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
Using multiple features gives a better housing price prediction compared to using a single feature like area.
